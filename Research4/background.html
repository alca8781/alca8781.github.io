        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>AI judges are primarily used to assist in decision-making, 
            risk assessment, and predicting recidivism. <br>
            They can process large volumes of data quickly, potentially leading to more
             efficient judicial processes.

                <h3>USES:</h3>
                <h4> - Auxiliary administrative functions <br>
                    - Communication between judicial personnel <br>
                    - Allocation of resources and cases <br>
                    - Score offenders risk of reoffending <br>
                    - Recommends alternative punishment to <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;low risk people <br>
                    - Ensures anonymisation of <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;decisions / documents / data <br>

                <h3>PROS:</h3>
                <h4> - AI lowers the administrative burden of cases<br> 
                    - Increase court efficiency / reduce backlog of cases<br>  
                    - Allows for standardized outcomes <br>
                    - Lower costs <br>
                    - More accessible to people who cannot afford lawyers <br>
                    - Improves fairness by:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following strict precedents <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent personal bias<br> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handle large amounts of information <br>
                    - Can be used to help judges find relevant legal provisions and 
                    thorough data retrieval which can improve judges understanding
                    and avoid one sided access to data <br> 
                    - Significantly increase the probability of offering alternative punishment <br> 
                    - Decrease probability of incarceration <br> 
                    - Shortens length of imprisonment <br>

                <h3>CONS:</h3>
                <h4> - Allocation of cases to a specific judge based on<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expertise / bias could indirectly influence outcome<br> 
                    - AI can perpetuate discrimination if allowed

        <h5>AI SENTENCING:</h5>
        <p>AI calculates risk of repeat offense 
            People who AI deemed low-risk offenders <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> 16% lower incarceration for drug crimes <br>
            ->11% lower incarceration for fraud<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;->6% lower incarceration for larceny <br><br>
            Decreases financial burden of states with high incarceration costs <br>
             AI decreased jail sentences by an average of 1 month <br>
             AI sentencing advice makes it less likely for offenders to be back in jail <br>
            Following AI sentencing recommendations reduces incarceration and recidivism <br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;judges disproportionally declined to offer alternative to <br>

                            - Black defendants were given significantly lower alternative punishments <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;and longer jail terms than White counterparts

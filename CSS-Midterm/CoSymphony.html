                            <p>Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a powerhouse 
                                program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking and admired as ever, 
                                this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through 
                                music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso 
                                to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert Hall.
                                The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate that endures 
                                as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements, Tchaikovsky transforms his 
                                personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art. Among today’s best and brightest 
                                composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance, movement, and American folk expressions in an
                                 ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of your seat.

                            <p>History is replete with turning points and with the completion of his revolutionary Third Symphony, Beethoven 
                                forever changed the idea of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and Romantic eras, the 
                                Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means to be human in a work that is larger and more emotional than 
                                a symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to the forefront, using broad strokes of sound
                                 to convey the very nature of humanity, while reimagining a future for music filled with endless possibility. 
                                 Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher Career Grant recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello
                                  Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring themes and quiet anguish that will leave audiences 
                                  entranced. The Colorado Symphony Chorus takes center stage on Vaughan Williams’ Walt Whitman-inspired Toward 
                                  the Unknown Region, a remarkable marriage of music and text, with Williams’ inspired music perfectly 
                                  encapsulating Whitman’s noble, humanistic aspirations. These works will spring to life in the hands of Maestro 
                                  Peter Oundjian and your Colorado Symphony.

                    <p>Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic compositions — placed himself among the greats of the 
                        keyboard with the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with towering grandeur, gorgeously 
                        lyrical melodies, and unmistakable Romantic spirit. For pianists what Everest is to climbers, the Concerto in B-flat 
                        has become the standard against which all virtuosos must measure themselves, featuring iconic opening flourishes and a 
                        pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite Olga Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this 
                        cornerstone of the Classical Canon. Your Colorado Symphony and Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” 
                        by the San Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s stormy and brooding Tenth Symphony. Written 
                        to symbolize the power of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and complex orchestrations that mirror his 
                        own battles against Soviet oppression. Ending on a triumphant note, this is a finale that will leave you breathless

                    <p>Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, which he called a 
                        “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense of powerful, dramatic music which defies category and 
                        springs to life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score creates a sensuous atmosphere with a lingering explosiveness 
                        residing just underneath the surface. Scored for a massive orchestra and utilizing the ethereal, intangible tones of a 
                        wordless chorus, Ravel often spotlights solo players in a way that recalls chamber music rather than merely using it as a 
                        show of force, pulling listeners into a vast, visceral dreamscape of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion. Szymanowski’s First 
                        Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of Concertmaster Yumi Hwang-Williams, who brings expressive virtuosity to one of the first 
                        violin concertos of the modern era. The program opens with Lili Boulanger’s D’un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a spring morning,’ 
                        capturing the genius of this prodigious composer who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age of just 24. 
                        This sweet and playful ode to spring is just the transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.

            History of Parasocial Relationships <br>
            ____________________________<br><br>
        
        <p id="no1"> In 1956, the term parasocial relationship was coined by Donald Horton and R. Richard Wohl. They focused on the psychological attachment that was formed from viewing television personalities and how it caused users 
            to feel illusions of intimacy, friendship, and identification. <br> <br>

            The more frequent and conversational that the media persona is, the more media users feel high levels of intimacy, loyalty, 
            and friendship. <br><br>
            
            Psychological attachment forms when the media persona offers a continuing relationship with the media user. 
            As the availability to interact and see into these celebrities intimate lives increases, influencers have had to share more 
            and more to keep their viewers engaged. <br><br>

            Influencers and celebrities make money off of veiwership and followers but there is a cost. Many media personel feel obligated to share personal details of their lives leaving them with very little privacy and an increased risk for parasocial relationships to emerge. <br> <br>
